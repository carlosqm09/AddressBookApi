üìò Repository Description
AddressBookApp (.NET Minimal API)

This project implements a RESTful backend for an address book application using .NET 8, Minimal APIs, and Swagger. The architecture follows Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into well-defined layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Interface.
